# News articles websites summrization
 
Summarization can be defined as the task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information and overall meaning. Impact Summarization systems often have additional evidence they can utilize to specify the most important topics of a document(s). For example, when summarizing blogs, discussions, or comments coming after the blog post that are good sources of information to determine which parts of the blog are critical and interesting.  
in this project, I will scrap and summarize two news websites one with English content which is [Washington news website](https://github.com/ebtesamali/MadinaNews_website_summrization/blob/main/washington_news_article_summraization.ipynb), and the other with Arabic content which is [Madina news website](https://github.com/ebtesamali/MadinaNews_website_summrization/blob/main/Madina_News_Summraization.ipynb)

### This project has two main tasks :
1. scraping Madina and Washington news websites to get the articles, using `urllib.request` and `BeautifulSoup `
2. summarizing the articles using diffrent laibraires like : `nltk`, `collections`, `heapq`

### NOTE : 
This project is considered simple as it uses only a based rules approach, summarization can be made in a more accurate and better way using the machine learning  and deep learning
